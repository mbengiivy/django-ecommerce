## GIT AND GITHUB ESSENTIALS TRAINING

## This is a forked repository where I was able to do the following:
 1. Create a fork from the original
 2. Create a branch-updates
 3. Make some small changes in the code ie. changing Address to Address One
 4. Merging changes with master branch
 5. Creating a branch-resolve=updates- to solve the conflicts that were emerging from the forked repository


## The following are commands that I was able to use:
1. git status
2. git add *
3. git checkout -b""
4. git merge
5. git log
6. git push origin master
7. git pull origin master
   
## Challenges that I faced:
1. I kept forgetting to push to master and that almost made me lack conflicts
2. I had to use simple branch names that related to the function of the branch


##Open source repository that I have explored:
https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/issues/4008

I gave a suggestion, to introduce dark mode for the ecommerce website
